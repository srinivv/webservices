Always: 
Run the HelloWorldPublisher.java

Hit to check the wsdl: http://localhost:9999/ws/hello?wsdl 

(OR)
Run the HelloWorldClient.java

(OR)
Alternative, you can use “wsimport” tool to parse the published wsdl file, and generate necessary client files (stub) to access the published web service.

Where is wsimport?
This wsimport tool is bundle with the JDK, you can find it at “JDK_PATH/bin” folder.
Issue “wsimport” command.

wsimport -keep http://localhost:9999/ws/hello?wsdl

It will generate stubs in jdk bin folder itself. Copied those files in to com.soap.wsimport
